## CSS__is-not--Hard/Easy

#### CSS to me is like Kryptonite to Superman.
I have very strong React skills (I overheard from a co-developer in my Team- I embrace it),  
but I was always vulnerable to CSS.   When I’m into a new project, I am always excited about the functionalities I will build. 
Ok this button makes this, and that component can be re used. . So on.
I would built them over couple of days and get excited about giving out demo.
I would lay bunch of elements lying on the UI doing exactly what they are suppose to do. . . 
But a Button is overlapped by an image, and icon are scattered as if they are poured on the screen by a dumpster. 


and it makes me feel like having an iron man suit build in a Cave. 

After all the struggle of going over many tutorials, udemy course, blogspots, articles on writing better CSS. I was not able to achieve what I am looking for. 

So I set back my self a little bit and asked me what is stopping to learn CSS which has simple elegant user friendly syntax.
Hmmmm. . . . I am applying a random solution to a problem with out completely understanding the problem.( The bad part is that my problem have more possible solutions than any other).   Now analyzing the problem i found a deep rooted cause. 
 I always underestimated this beautiful language thinking it is all about margins and paddings and with few trial and errors, I should be able to get it. I was wrong in every possible dimension in the universe. 

It's high time to invest more time in to my CSS skills.
